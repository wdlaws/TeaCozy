Unit 4 Codecademy project on CSS and Flexbox
Hi. I found this project mostly okay. One area I had difficulty with was the locations box (div class = locations). If I set the height of the div to 500px, the content was auto-adjusting within the div and I found it hard to get the spacing I wanted. I solved the problem by setting margins and paddings for the elements so that they added up to 500px. But was there a better way? Thanks!
